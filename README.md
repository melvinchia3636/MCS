<center><h1 align="center">🐝 Minecraft Server List - Redesign for Minecraft.buzz</h1></center>

<p align="center">A site aimed to help other players like me find Minecraft servers that are worth playing on. </p>

## The Problem

Minecraft allows players to set up a server freely and play together in it. After more than 10 years of evolution, countless amazing servers have emerged around the world. At the same time, lots of community members have created websites that collect information about these servers so that players can browse and search for their desired server. As a Minecraft player, I would really like to make one myself as well.

## The Solution

Since there's no way for me to collect data by myself and create the website from scratch, I decided to pick an existing Minecraft server list, use its content, redesign it, and remake it. Turns out that it's an amazing opportunity for me to practice and consolidate my React skills.
